# Weather-App powered by React and TypeScript

After months of mastering Javascript, HTML and CSS, I felt confident to progress to React for Front-End Development. I completed an official React Certificate at which I learned major concepts of React as well as Typescript and React-Routing. 

I'm proud to present you my re-programmed Weather App which was built on **React** and **Typescript**. Core-Concepts such as Routing, useState-, useEffect-, useContext- and Custom-Hooks where used to build my Weather anew. 

For your information: You need an API-Key from [Open Weather](https://openweathermap.org/) to get the full functionality. 

## Tech Stack 
- TailwindCSS -> Styling
- Typescript -> better Code practises
- EsLint and Prettier
- Axios -> HTTP requests
- React Libary -> Front-End Libary
- Open Weather API -> Weather Informaiton

## Future Features
- Mobile Support
- Custom Hooks -> Cleaner Code
- implement useTransition-Hook -> ensure smooth Transitions at lower Network speed
